# Archive of Downloaded 3D Printed Projects #

I am fairly new to the world of 3D Printing. I getting my first 3D Printer, a Creality 3D Ender 3, in July of 2018 and I quickly be came a 3D Printing Addict. I have made many upgrades to my Ender 3, including a BLTouch and a new Hot End, but I wanted something with a bigger build volume so in February 2019 I added a second printer, this time it was a Creality 3D CR-10s Pro.

This repository is a collection of some of the 3D Projects I have made using my two printers. Most of them I have downloaded from sources across the internet and few are my own custom designs. I have printing all of the projects in this collection and I have noted my settings, any the problems I ran in to, and hopefully examples of my successful prints. I have also included links to the original projects were possible, included STL files for freely available designs or information on how you can purchase a design the is not freely available.
