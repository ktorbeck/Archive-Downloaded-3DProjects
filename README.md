# Archive of Downloaded 3D Projects #

I am fairly new to the world of 3D Printing only getting my first 3D Printer, a Creality 3D Ender 3, in July of 2018. This archive is a collection of 3D Projects I have downloaded from different sources across the internet. I have printing all of the projects in this collection and I have noted my settings, any the problems I ran in to, and hopefully examples of my successful prints. 

I have also included links to the original projects were possible.
