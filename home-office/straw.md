## Description ##
**"From my cold dead lips!"**

With governments around the United States and other nations outlawing plastic straws, based on data from a kids school report, I decided to download this project by Gregory E Nator and make a joke video spoofing the news reports on both banning straws and 3D Printed Guns. While the straw printed fine at the time I did not know if any of the PLA I had was considered food safe so I did not use it to drink from.
