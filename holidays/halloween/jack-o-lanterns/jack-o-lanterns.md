# Tea Light Jack O Lanterns #

## Description ##
Jack-o'-lantern Pumpkins with separate stems. This project is my revision of several Tea Light Jack-o'-lanterns Pumpkins download from Thingiverse. I have tried to include references to all the designs I used for my project, but I may have missed a few. I plan on making my own revision to post on Thingiverse for 2020.


Project Name | Designer | Project URL | Notes
---------|----------|---------|---------
 Makies Jack-O-Lantern | [MakieLab](https://www.thingiverse.com/Makies/about) | https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:167043 | I think this is the Original Project that started all of this, because it is the only one with the stem being part of the top. I have never printed this version.
Jack-O-Lantern snap-on lid | [CHRISTINA CHUN](https://www.thingiverse.com/christinachun/about) | https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:169148 | Designer altered the lid so that it snaps on. This was the first revision I started to print with the idea of painting the stem, before the print was even done I found the next revision.
 Makies Jack-O-Lantern Redux 1.0 | [Chris Milnes](https://www.thingiverse.com/muckychris/about) | https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:169693 | This designer made a few important changes, the biggest is separating the stem from the top. I printed many copies of this of this project last year using a X-Acto knife to trim out the mouth.
 Jack-o'-lantern Pumpkin with separate stem | [Trevor Shurtz](https://www.thingiverse.com/eight_heads/about) | https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3098466 | After the mess I had made the year before trimming out the mouth I had decided to edit design to have an open mouth. However, while looking for the Redux 1.0 design from the year before I came across this revision in which the designer had beat me to it. However, his design is larger than the others, maybe to make it easier for him to make his changes, so I had to resize everything. I did not do the best job and had to trim the stems to make them fit. I printed two dozen versions of this design for Halloween 2019.
Classic Jack-o-lantern | [Ben Eagan](https://www.thingiverse.com/benrules2/about) | https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:483564 | I wanted a little variety, so I download this design which has a more traditional Jack-o-lantern face. I resized it to match the others and used the top and stem from the "Jack-o'-lantern Pumpkin with separate stem". I printed about a dozen for Halloween 2019.
