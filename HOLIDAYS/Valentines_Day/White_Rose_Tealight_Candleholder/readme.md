## Description ## 
A beautiful tealight candle holder in the shape of a rose bud desiged by [Bergil J St Juste](https://www.myminifactory.com/users/Jeanius87) and downloaded from his My Mini Factory Page -  [White Rose Tealight Candleholder](https://www.myminifactory.com/object/3d-print-white-rose-tealight-candleholder-18538).

While the photos from the original project show a real tealight candle being used, I decided to use a [led tealight](https://amzn.to/2GKDeJz) purchased from Amazon.
